Introduction:
- Analyses a maternal health dataset to uncover insights to improve maternal well-being and reduce mortality.

Methodology:  
- Performs exploratory data analysis like outlier detection, missing value handling
- Does correlation analysis, PCA, clustering, and association rule mining find insights
- Builds linear regression and PCA models to predict systolic blood pressure 
- Relates age groups to heart rate and systolic blood pressure

Libraries Used:
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Skills Demonstrated:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection 
- Regression, PCA, clustering, association rule mining
- Model evaluation metrics
- Associative Data Mining in (Basket/Cart Analysis)
- Statistical analysis and visualization 

Outcomes: 
- Identified relationships between age, blood pressure, blood sugar, and risk levels
- Built models to predict systolic blood pressure
- Provided recommendations like age-specific risk monitoring  

In summary, the analysis showcases skills in exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, to uncover insights from a healthcare dataset. The implementation leverages Python data science libraries to derive findings.
